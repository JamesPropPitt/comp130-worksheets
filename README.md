Over the course of the entire term, Steven and I worked on and implemented close to 80% of the game in total due to the lack of support and attendance from the other 2 programmers on the team. 
## Sprint 1
* I put forward the team name 'Exploding Fish' this was because the previous game idea that I also put forward was a game about exploding fish which stemmed from my twisted mind...
* Helped the team set up the Trello and Slack pages
## Sprint 2
* Pair programming with Steven

## Sprint 3
* Figured out how to attach the sword to the actor so that it moved and worked as a hitbox
* Accidentally overwrote progress so the previous bullet point's progress is redundant.
* Attached sword to actor again
## Sprint 4
* Added the code so that the player can actually die.
* Added the code so that the AI can actually die.
## Sprint 5
