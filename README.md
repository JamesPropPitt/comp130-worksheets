Over the course of the entire term, Steven and I worked on and implemented close to 80% of the game in total due to the lack of support and attendance from the other 2 programmers on the team. 
## Sprint 0
* I put forward the team name 'Exploding Fish' this was because the previous game idea that I also put forward was a game about exploding fish which stemmed from my twisted mind...
* Helped the team set up the Trello and Slack pages
## Sprint 1
* Pair programming with Steven
* Figured out how to attach the sword to the actor so that it moved and worked as a hitbox
* Accidentally overwrote progress so the previous bullet point's progress is redundant.
* Attached sword to actor again
## Sprint 2
* Added the code so that the player can actually die.
* Added the code so that the AI can actually die.
* Imported the animations.
### PRESENTATION SPRINT, NO WORK TOOK PLACE
## Sprint 4
* Changed the scenery.
* Added fog
* Added death screen
* Fixed the animations and successfully implemented them.
* Supported other members of the team with their work.
## Sprint 5
* Content lock, but we still carried on adding content due to the sheer amount of content we lacked
* Textured the buildings
* Attached sword with hitboxes to the character for the 3rd time
